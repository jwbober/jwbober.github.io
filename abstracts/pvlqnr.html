<h4>PÃ³lya-Vinogradov and the least quadratic nonresidue
    (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7556">arXiv</a>)</h4>
<p>
It is well-known that cancellation in short character sums (e.g. Burgess'
estimates) yields bounds on the least quadratic nonresidue. Scant progress has
been made on short character sums since Burgess' work, so it is desirable to
find a new approach to nonresidues. The goal of this note is to demonstrate a
new line of attack via long character sums, a currently active area of
research. Among other results, we demonstrate that improving the constant in
the Polya-Vinogradov inequality would lead to significant progress on
nonresidues. Moreover, conditionally on a conjecture on long character sums, we
show that the least nonresidue for any odd primitive character (mod \(k\)) is
bounded by \((logk)1.4\).
