<h4>New computations of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line
    (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00709">1607.00709</a>)</h4>
<p>
We present highlights of computations of the Riemann zeta function around large
values and high zeros. The main new ingredient in these computations is an
implementation of the second author's fast algorithm for numerically evaluating
quadratic exponential sums. In addition, we use a new simple multi-evaluation
method to compute the zeta function in a very small range at little more than
the cost of evaluation at a single point.
