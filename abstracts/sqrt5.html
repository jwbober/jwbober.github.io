<h4>A database of of elliptic curves over $\Q(\sqrt 5)$ - First report (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6612">arXiv</a>)</h4>
<p>
We describe a tabulation of (conjecturally) modular elliptic curves over the field $\Q(\sqrt 5)$ up to the first curve of rank 2. Using an efficient implementation of an algorithm of Lassina Dembele, we computed tables of Hilbert modular forms of weight (2,2) over $\Q(\sqrt 5)$, and via a variety of methods we constructed corresponding elliptic curves, including (again, conjecturally) all elliptic curves over $\Q(\sqrt 5)$ that have conductor with norm less than or equal to 1831.
