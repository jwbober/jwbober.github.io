<h4>Averages of character sums
    (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1840">arXiv</a>)</h4>
<p>
We show that a short truncation of the Fourier expansion for a character sum
gives a good approximation for the average value of that character sum over an
interval.  We give a few applications of this result. One is that for any b
there are infinitely many characters for which the sum up to \(\approx aq/b\)
is \(q^{1/2} \log\log q\) for all a relatively prime to b; another is that if
the least quadratic nonresidue modulo \(q \equiv 3 \pmod 4\) is large, then the character
sum gets as large as \(\sqrt{q}/\pi)(L(1, \chi) + \log 2 - \epsilon)\) and if \(B\) is this nonresidue, then there is a sum of length \(q/B\) which has size \((\sqrt{q}/\pi)(\log 2 - \epsilon)\).
