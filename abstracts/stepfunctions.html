<h4>Bounded step functions and factorial ratio sequences (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3459">arXiv</a>)</h4>
<p>
We study certain step functions whose nonnegativity is related to the integrality of sequences of ratios of factorial products. In particular, we obtain a lower bound for the mean square of such step functions which allows us to give a restriction on when such a factorial ratio sequence can be integral. Additionally, we note that this work has applications to the classification of cyclic quotient singularities.
