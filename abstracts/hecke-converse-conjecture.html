<h4>A conjectural extension of Hecke's converse theorem
    (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02570">1704.02570</a>)</h4>
<p>
We formulate a precise conjecture that, if true, extends the converse theorem
of Hecke without requiring hypotheses on twists by Dirichlet characters or an
Euler product. The main idea is to linearize the Euler product, replacing it by
twists by Ramanujan sums. We provide evidence for the conjecture, including
proofs of some special cases and under various additional hypotheses.
