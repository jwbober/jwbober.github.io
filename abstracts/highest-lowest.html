<h4>The highest lowest zero of general L-functions (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5996">arXiv</a>)</h4>
<p>
Stephen D. Miller showed that, assuming the generalized Riemann Hypothesis,
every entire $L$-function of real archimedian type has a zero in the interval
\(\frac12+i t\) with \(-t_0 \lt t \lt t_0\), where \(t_0\approx 14.13\)
corresponds to the first zero of the Riemann zeta function.  We give an example
of a self-dual degree-4 L-function whose first positive imaginary zero is at
\(t_1\approx 14.496\).  In particular, Miller's result does not hold for
general L-functions.  We show that all L-functions satisfying some additional
(conjecturally true) conditions have a zero in the interval \((-t_2,t_2)\) with
\(t_2\approx 22.661\).
